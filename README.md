# English Premier League Football

## Introduction:
The English Premier League was Formed in February 20, 1992 and is contested by 20 clubs
The EPL is the world’s most-watched football league with an ever-growing global audience of potentially around 5 billion people
Also, the English Premier League is now the world’s richest league in terms of money, which comes close to over 3 billion English Pounds Sterling
Every season, the three lowest placed teams in are relegated to the Championship, while the top two from the Championship get promoted to the Premier League, with an additional team promoted through play-offs
The plan in this coursework is to work on a Premier League football dataset, and focusing on analyzing the performance of the relegated teams, testing various hypothesis and identifying common patterns

## Objectives:
To identify key patterns in the relegated teams compared to the rest over the last 10 seasons and determine the possible reasons behind relegation

## Data collection:
After thorough research, a suitable dataset - based on relevancy to the topic and since the dataset coves 10 full seasons - was identified and acquired from the following github repository (https://github.com/tara-nguyen/english-premier-league-datasets-for-10-seasons/)
The acquired data covers 10 premier league seasons from season 2010/11 to season 2019/20. It consists of 11 csv files covering two main aspects:
Match statistics, containing the head-to-head match statistics across all ten seasons
10 season-end league tables
As indicated in the repo, data is free to use from a github user:TARA NGUYEN
